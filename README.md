Hi, I’m Kenan

🚀 From Elite Naval Operations to Frontend Development — building disciplined, scalable, and user-focused web experiences.

🧭 Background

Former SAS Commando in the Turkish Naval Forces, currently transitioning into the Software Development field with a focus on Frontend & Web Technologies.

Career Transition: Military ➜ Technology

🪖 About Me

I served as a SAS Commando within the Turkish Naval Forces, where I held multiple leadership and command roles, including:

Special Diving Team Commander

Coastal Surveillance Station Commander

Security & Guard Platoon Commander

Acting Barracks Commander

Throughout my naval career, I developed strong skills in discipline, leadership, problem-solving, analytical thinking, and decision-making under pressure.

I am now transitioning into the Software Development field, focusing on Frontend and Web Technologies, where structured thinking, attention to detail, and continuous learning are essential.

💡 Why Tech?

Military service taught me how to operate in complex systems, follow structured processes, and perform under pressure. Software development offers a similar environment — solving problems, building systems step by step, and continuously improving.

Technology allows me to combine my operational discipline and leadership mindset with creativity and logic, turning ideas into functional, user-centered digital products.
